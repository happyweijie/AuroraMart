# Admin Panel Authentication Setup

## ✅ Step 7 Implementation Complete

This document confirms that **Step 7: Admin Authentication** from Phase 2 has been fully implemented.

## 🔐 Superuser Credentials

The system is configured with the following admin credentials:

- **Username:** `admin`
- **Password:** `P@55W0RD`
- **Email:** `admin@auroramart.com`

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. Create Superuser

Run the management command to create the admin superuser:

```bash
python manage.py create_admin
```

This will automatically:
- Delete any existing admin account
- Create a new superuser with the credentials above
- Display a success message confirming the creation

### 2. Start the Development Server

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

### 3. Access the Admin Panel

Navigate to: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/panel/login/`

Login with:
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `P@55W0RD`

## 🛡️ Security Features Implemented

### @staff_required Decorator

Location: `admin_panel/decorators.py`

**Features:**
- Checks if user is authenticated
- Verifies user has `is_staff` permission
- Redirects unauthenticated users to admin login page
- Redirects non-staff users to storefront home
- Shows appropriate error messages

**Usage Example:**
```python
from admin_panel.decorators import staff_required

@staff_required
def my_admin_view(request):
    # Only staff members can access this view
    return render(request, 'my_template.html')
```

### Protected Admin Views

All admin panel views are now protected with `@staff_required`:

✅ **Dashboard** (`/panel/dashboard/`)
✅ **Product Management** (`/panel/products/`)
✅ **Category Management** (`/panel/categories/`)
✅ **Inventory Management** (`/panel/inventory/`)
✅ **Pricing Management** (`/panel/pricing/`)
✅ **Customer Records** (`/panel/customers/`)
✅ **Order Management** (`/panel/orders/`)
✅ **Review Management** (`/panel/reviews/`)
✅ **Promotion Management** (`/panel/promotions/`)
